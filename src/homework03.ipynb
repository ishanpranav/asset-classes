    "# Asset classes\n",
    "\n",
    "This investigation examines the behavior of various asset classes over time to\n",
    "empirically test conventional notions about portfolio management.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider the following asset classes: equities, fixed-income securities\n",
    "(that is, debt instruments), and real estate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Which asset class offers the best Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted return)?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hypothesis:__ Real estate. Real estate is highly illiquid, so its volatility\n",
    "is generally low, which should drive up its Sharpe ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who: this question affects risk-minimizing, return-maximizing investors\n",
    "* What: finance\n",
    "* Where: United States\n",
    "* When: 1987–_present_\n",
    "* Amount of data required: we would like to analyze the largest data set\n",
    "  possible while still keeping our series comparable and consistent. Since the\n",
    "  S&P Case–Shiller real estate index was introduced in 1978, this is the earliest\n",
    "  reasonable start date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "How are these asset classes correlated with interest rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hypothesis:__ All three asset classes should exhibit a strong positive\n",
    "correlation with interest rates. However, the illiquidity and lock-in effects of\n",
    "real estate may cause surprising results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who: this question affects researchers, instutitons, and investors\n",
    "* What: finance, economics\n",
    "* Where: United States\n",
    "* When: 1987–_present_\n",
    "* Amount of data required: annual time series since 1987\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How are these asset classes correlated with each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hypothesis:__ All three asset classes should be positively correlated with\n",
    "one another, since they all move inversely to interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who: this question affects researchers, instutitons, and investors\n",
    "* What: finance, economics\n",
    "* Where: United States\n",
    "* When: 1987–_present_\n",
    "* Amount of data required: annual time series since 1987\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "FRED, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, offers the most relevant,\n",
    "consistent, and reliable consortium of economic and financial data. We wish to\n",
    "investigate equities, fixed-income securities, and real estate in relation to\n",
    "the risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the S&P 500 Index as a proxy for the U.S. equities market. We use an\n",
    "adjusted time series that includes the total returns for the index: that is, the\n",
    "sum of price returns and the annual dividend yield. We recognize that the S&P\n",
    "500 Index disproportionately overrepresents large-capitalization companies, but\n",
    "given that it historically accounts for 75 percent of the U.S. equity market\n",
    "(per FRED), it is a relatively good proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the ICE BofA U.S. Corporate Index as a proxy for the U.S. bond\n",
    "market, noting that this index is restricted to corporate bonds and is a total\n",
    "return index.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the S&P Case–Shiller Index as a proxy for the U.S. real estate\n",
    "market, recognizing, of course, that this index restricts itself to residential\n",
    "real estate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will use the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond rate as a proxy for the\n",
    "risk-free rate. This is the most appropriate proxy because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. our assets are U.S.-based and dollar-denominated,\n",
    "2. our assets are have long durations, and\n",
    "3. we seek a risk-free rate with a minimal illiquidity premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although each decision is flawed, these appear to be the best proxies available\n",
    "as corroborated by\n",
    "[FRED's own articles](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2022/10/real-returns-on-major-asset-classes-since-the-start-of-the-pandemic)\n",
    "and the general conventions among financial economists.\n",
